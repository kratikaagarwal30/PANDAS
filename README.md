Data Analysis Projects Repository

Overview: 

This repository contains a series of Python-based data analysis projects, each focusing on a different dataset and objective. From exploring the impact of COVID-19, analyzing IPL matches, predicting credit card approvals, to understanding hotel booking dynamics, these projects utilize the power of Pandas and other data science libraries to extract meaningful insights from raw data.

Projects

1. COVID-19 Analysis
Script: COVID_19 analysis.py
Dataset: raw_data[1].csv, transformed_data[1].csv
Objective: Analyze the spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
2. IPL Analysis
Script: IPL Analysis.py
Dataset: matches - matches.csv
Objective: Investigate trends and performances in IPL matches.
3. Credit Card Approval Prediction
Script: credit card prediction.py
Dataset: bank-additional-full[1].csv
Objective: Predict the likelihood of credit card approvals based on customer data.
4. Hotel Booking Analysis
Script: Pandas on hotel dataset.py
Dataset: hotel_bookings.csv
Objective: Explore booking trends and identify factors affecting hotel booking cancellations.

Prerequisites

1. Pandas
2. NumPy
3. Matplotlib (for visualizations)
4. Scikit-learn (for predictive modeling in the credit card project)
